The index.html file contains the webpage and the functionality and has no dependencies.

The zip file is currently the template that the index.html file uses to create the output kml file.


A user can go in and simply put the zipcodes and associated populations that they want (should be able to copy-paste from excel or other spreadsheets), and hit the generate kml button to get a kml that contains filled in zipcodes.
